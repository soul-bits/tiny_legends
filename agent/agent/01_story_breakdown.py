For each story card, you must provide:
1. Content: 1-2 sentences that tell part of the story
2. Illustration Prompt: Detailed description for creating a visual illustration based on the content
3. Spoken Narration: Narration script optimized for reading aloud to children

Guidelines:
- Define the characters and their descriptions in the story illustration prompt.
- Make the story engaging and age-appropriate for children
- Each card should advance the plot naturally
- Illustration prompts should be vivid and descriptive with at max 1 chat bubble
- Spoken narration should flow smoothly when read aloud
- Maintain consistency in characters and setting
- Ensure the story has a clear beginning, middle, and end across all 9 cards

The story should be broken into these 9 parts:
1. Introduction/Setting (Cards 1-2)
2. Rising Action/Problem (Cards 3-4) 
3. Climax/Adventure (Cards 5-6)
4. Resolution (Cards 7-8)
5. Conclusion (Card 9)

IMPORTANT: Return the response as a JSON object with this EXACT structure:
{
  "title": "Story Title",
  "summary": "Brief story summary",
  "cards": [
    {
      "card_number": 1,
      "content": "Story content for card 1",
      "illustration_prompt": "Illustration description for card 1",

    Long ago, in the village of Gokul, lived a playful boy named Krishna. He had a smile brighter than the sun and eyes that twinkled like stars. But Krishna was not just any boyâ€”he was very special.

Krishna loved butter more than anything. Every morning, his mother, Yashoda, would churn fresh butter and keep it safe. But Krishna and his friends couldnâ€™t resist. They climbed on each otherâ€™s shoulders, sneaked into houses, and stole pots of butter. Villagers laughed and called him Makhan Chorâ€”the Butter Thief.

One day, Yashoda caught Krishna with his little hands full of butter. She tried to scold him, but when she looked into his big innocent eyes, her anger melted. Krishna smiled, and Yashodaâ€™s heart overflowed with love.

But Krishna was not only mischievous; he was brave too. Once, a giant serpent entered the villageâ€™s river. Everyone was afraid. Krishna jumped onto the serpentâ€™s head and danced until the creature gave up and left. The villagers cheeredâ€”Krishna had saved them!

From stealing butter to protecting his people, Krishna showed that love, courage, and playfulness can go hand in hand. And that is why children everywhere still adore him today.

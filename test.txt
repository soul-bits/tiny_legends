Long ago, in the village of Gokul, lived a playful boy named Krishna. He had a smile brighter than the sun and eyes that twinkled like stars. But Krishna was not just any boy—he was very special.

Krishna loved butter more than anything. Every morning, his mother, Yashoda, would churn fresh butter and keep it safe. But Krishna and his friends couldn’t resist. They climbed on each other’s shoulders, sneaked into houses, and stole pots of butter. Villagers laughed and called him *Makhan Chor*—the Butter Thief.

One day, Yashoda caught Krishna with his little hands full of butter. She tried to scold him, but when she looked into his big innocent eyes, her anger melted. Krishna smiled, and Yashoda’s heart overflowed with love.

But Krishna was not only mischievous; he was brave too. Once, a giant serpent entered the village’s river. Everyone was afraid. Krishna jumped onto the serpent’s head and danced until the creature gave up and left. The villagers cheered—Krishna had saved them!

From stealing butter to protecting his people, Krishna showed that love, courage, and playfulness can go hand in hand. And that is why children everywhere still adore him today.
